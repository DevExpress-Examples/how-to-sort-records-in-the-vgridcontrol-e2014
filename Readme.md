# How to sort records in the Vertical Grid control

In our v21.1 release cycle, users can utilize a row header's context menu to sort data in the [Vertical Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/2449/controls-and-libraries/vertical-grid?v=21.1) control. Set the [AllowSort](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraVerticalGrid.VGridOptionsBehavior.AllowSort?v=21.1) property to **false** to disable this functionality.

You can also enable the control's [AllowSortOnClick](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraVerticalGrid.VGridOptionsBehavior.AllowSortOnClick?v=21.1) option to sort data when users click on a row header. See the following topic for more information: [Sort Vertical Grid Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/403034/controls-and-libraries/vertical-grid/sorting?v=21.1).
