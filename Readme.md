# How to sort records in the VGridControl


<p>In the current version <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/clsDevExpressXtraVerticalGridVGridControltopic">VGridControl</a> doesn't support sorting. We have a suggestion to implement this feature in a future version: <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/CS51574">Sort records</a>. This example demonstrates how to emulate this feature by sorting the VGridControl's data source when the user clicks within the row header.</p>
